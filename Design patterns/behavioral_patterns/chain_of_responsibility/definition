The Chain of Responsibility pattern:

 is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to send a request through a chain of potential handlers.
 Each handler in the chain can either process the request or pass it along to the next handler. 
 This allows multiple objects to have the chance to handle the request without the sender needing to know which one will handle it.



To implement the Chain of Responsibility pattern:

1-Create a base handler interface or abstract class that defines a method for handling requests 
and a reference to the next handler in the chain.

2-Implement concrete handler classes that inherit from the base handler and provide specific request handling logic.

3-Set up the chain by linking the handlers together in sequence, allowing a request to pass through the chain until it is handled
