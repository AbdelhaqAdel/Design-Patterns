Definition:

The State Pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It encapsulates state-specific behavior into separate classes, avoiding conditionals and making state transitions more flexible. Each state class defines its own behavior, and the object delegates tasks to the current state.


Steps to Implement the State Pattern:

1-Create a State Interface: Define an interface that declares methods representing behavior for various states.

2-Implement Concrete States: Create classes for each state that implement the interface with state-specific behavior.

3-Create a Context Class: Hold a reference to the current state and allow switching states dynamically.

4-Delegate Behavior: The context class delegates requests to the current state, which handles the behavior based on its specific logic.

5-Switch States at Runtime: Change the state object in response to events or conditions to modify the object's behavior.
